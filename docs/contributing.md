Mavenlink has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. [Please read the full text](./code_of_conduct.md) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Submitting Changes
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Make your changes. Be sure to look at [our component design principles](./principles.md)!
2. Add or update tests if necessary
3. If updating an exported component, add an entry in the "unreleased" section of the changelog. See [this example commit](https://github.com/mavenlink/design-system/commit/e0913fdbcb94b12df797a2d398d0d60e6d755b3d#diff-4ac32a78649ca5bdd8e0ba38b7006a1e).
4. Ensure the test suite passes by running `yarn test`
5. Ensure the linter passes by running `yarn lint`
6. Make a pull request
